### Assisted Literature Review - Springer Database
This code suite is a tool to use for improved and more efficient literature review.

The code retrieves scientific literature from the Springer database and parses the text fields into relational tables which can be stored in a database.

With text in this format, researches can more easily search through a literature database to filter down to literature of interest.

SpringerFetch.py does the work of searching for, and fetching documents, using Springer's API based on user-specified search terms.

SpringerParse.py parses the text from the documents into relational tables.

Users should use the Jupyter Notebook, `run_springer_search.ipynb`, to specify their search terms, retrieve and view results.

You can read more about the Springer API here: https://dev.springernature.com/
